# OneSource
One Source ERP is an open source project which aims to provide a well-integrated system to offer a comprehensive and reliable view of Truth to your orgranization 

It's true that **no single source can provide a complete and unbiased view of the truth.**
Different sources often present information from various perspectives, and each may have its _own biases_, _limitations_, or _areas of focus_. 
That's why it's important to consult multiple sources and consider different viewpoints when seeking information

Our platform is built on the philosophy that no single source can provide all the truth, but a well-integrated system can offer a comprehensive and reliable view.
